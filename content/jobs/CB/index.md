- Got in Coding Blocks to be a Campus Ambassador so that it would give me a
  chance to interact with students much more effectively and with enough
  resources. They are mostly into encouraging students with their career and
  future technology. Now Iâ€™ve been able to conduct workshops and started
  writing my own blogs
